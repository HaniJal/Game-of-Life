# Conway’s Game of Life (Java)

A Java implementation of **Conway’s Game of Life** using a 2D boolean grid.  
Cells are either **alive (true)** or **dead (false)** and evolve each generation based on the classic rules.

## Rules Implemented

For each cell, count its 8 neighbors:

- **Alive cell** survives if it has **2 or 3** alive neighbors  
- **Dead cell** becomes alive if it has **exactly 3** alive neighbors  
- Otherwise the cell becomes/remains dead
